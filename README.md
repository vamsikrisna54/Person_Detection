# Person_Detection

Developed a deep learning model using Yolov8 which can detect people in Real Time from Aerial shot Taken using a Drone.

### Problem Statement:-

->AI based Automatic person detection software which requires dropping of payload at persons through an Automated Drone.

->Challenge here is to detect human being from around 50-100 m above the ground at a slanted angle and then drop a payload.

->Technologies needed will be Drone, Cameras, Processor Board (Raspberry Pi or Intel NUC), Artificial Neural Network or AI hardware and Software, Payload dropping mechanism etc. 

### Technologies Used:-

->OPEN CV (COMPUTER VISION).

->YOLO by ultralytics

->matplotlib (pyplot).

->moviepy (MoviePy is a Python library for video editing: cutting, concatenations, title insertions, video compositing etcâ€¦)

### Use Cases
Disaster Management:

 ->Enables rapid delivery of essential supplies such as food and safety equipment, surpassing the speed of manned aerial vehicles. Additionally, it possesses automatic alarm generation capabilities.

Military:
 
 ->Its applications extend to precise strikes and surveillance operations, as well as the delivery of weaponry.

Search & Rescue:

->Facilitates the swift location of individuals in remote regions, enabling the prompt dispatch of rescue teams.

Poacher Detection:

->It can be used by the forestry department to prevent illicit forestry operations like poaching.

### Output:-
